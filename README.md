# homework-5

Homework 5 of the UW Coding Bootcamp tasks me with creating a work day scheduler that allows the user to input events that need to be done within business hours, and then save those tasks even when the page is refreshed.

The code works fine, although even with the CSS code to accompany the assignment, my text box text still remains white and the text for the hours are not centered correctly.
